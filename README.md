So ooc has this graphics framework, dye, right? And it's cool and high-level and stuff.

And lua is pretty cool to script, right? Except it's better to write moonscript.

And lua is easy to embed right? Except the ffi is slow when doing `C->Lua`, so we want
most of the game logic to run in lua, right?

So that's mostly what butt is about testing.
